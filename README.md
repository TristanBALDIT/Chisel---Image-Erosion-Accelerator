## Submission 2

Here is the second version of our accelerator. This time, the idea is to have virtually a cross-based layout over the image and implemented a diagonal traversal of the cross.

We are still using some buffers to remember data read from previous diagonal / cross.

The accelerator perform the erosion of imageCells in **562** cycles
